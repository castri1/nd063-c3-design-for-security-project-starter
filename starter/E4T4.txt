# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Adjust the default VPC security group and allow traffic on certain ports.
Add a Web application firewall sitting between the end users and the load balancer.
Add an SSL certificate and allow port 443 on the load balancer

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

With VPC endpoints requests that do not originate from the VPC network are blocked. If our web instance is somehow compromised, 
then the attacker will be able to pull the data from the bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. As per the documentation:
After you enable default encryption for a bucket, the following encryption behavior applies:
- There is no change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before default encryption was enabled.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

Cloudformation detects changes comparing the template and the infrastructure that is currently deployed. So if the original cloud formation templates
are applied, it'll reverse all the changes applied throughout the exercise.
