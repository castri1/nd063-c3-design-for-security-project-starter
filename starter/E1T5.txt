Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The web service instance is exposed directly to the internet.
Looking at the security group the instance is associated with, I can see that all ports are open and allows all kinds of traffic, i.e. I can access
the instance using its public DNS or connect directly to it via SSH.
This instance should be allowing traffic only from the load balancer.

# Poor practice 2
The exercise asks us to push the recipes content to the S3 buckets using the aws cli. Using the cli implies having aws secret access key and secret
access token to be able to interact with AWS's apis. Using these credentials might supose a vulnerability since we could loose them and be used to
access and attack the account.

# Poor practice 3
I can see that both s3 buckets don't have encryption at rest. In the context of the exercise we dont have sensitive data that could be stolen and
used in a wrong way. Using encryption at rest is always a good practice.
