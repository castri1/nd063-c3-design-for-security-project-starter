# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
For static code analysis:
Cloudformation code:
  - Cfripper
  - Cloudsploit
  - cfn-lint

Terraform cod:
  - Chef inspec
  - Open policy agent / Regula
  - Terrascan

### Example vulnerability
Security group allowing inbound traffic from anywhere. This means that security groups
are allowing TCP traffic from all sources to all ports.
The aforementioned is a bad practice as we are exposing the system publicly and make it vulnerable
to external attacks. External attacks can be perfomed out of our cloud or by another instance that has
been compromised within our VPC for example.
With a tool that performs a static code analysis to our IaC we can detect such bad practices before
deploying deploying changes to our current infrastructure.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
For Docker images we can use Clair
One way to prevent breaches is to regularly scan Docker images and compare the dependencies to a known list 
of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Public CVE lists contain an identification number, description, 
and at least one public reference for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 

### Example vulnerability
An example vulnerability related to Docker containers could be the following: 

CVE-ID:
CVE-2018-20699

Description
Docker Engine before 18.09 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (dockerd memory consumption) via a large 
integer in a --cpuset-mems or --cpuset-cpus value, related to daemon/daemon_unix.go, pkg/parsers/parsers.go, 
and pkg/sysinfo/sysinfo.go.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
AWS Config

### Example vulnerability
EBS volumes not encrypted.
EBS volumes are network hard drives that are attached to an EC2 instance. A good practice while using
these drives is to use encryption at rest and ensure the data stored in these drives is securely saved.
If an EC2 instance is compromised, the attacker could reach the volume and perform data exfiltration out of the volume.
Encrypting the volumes is a good way to reduce the blast radius of the attack.
