Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

As mentioned before all ports of the Web Service Instance - C3 are reachable from the internet.
The EBS volume attached to the web service instance is not encrypted.
SSH traffic for the security groups is accessible .
RDP traffic is Allowed from 0.0.0.0/0.
One or more HTTP listeners of the application load balancer do not have HTTP to HTTPS.
The default security group associated to the VPC accepts all traffic from all protocols and all ports.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Fix the vpc default security group to accept traffic only from the necessary ports.
Fix the security group from the web service instance to accept incoming traffic only from the load balancer security group in the port 5000, 
  delete the remaining inbound rules.
Enable encryption in the EBS volume attached to the instance.
