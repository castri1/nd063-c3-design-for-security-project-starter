# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty has detected two findings: 
One related to the instance that is performing the attack (severity HIGH) and the other one is related to the instance that is subject of the attack (severity LOW).
According to the documentation: This finding's severity is low if a brute force attack is aimed at one of your EC2 instances. This finding's severity is high if your EC2 instance is being used to perform the brute force attack.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

GuarDuty is a service for threat detection by continuously monitoring the network activity, data access patterns, 
and account behavior within the AWS environment. The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence 
feeds from AWS, CrowdStrike, and Proofpoint to identify and prioritize potential threats.

It's sources of information are the events generated across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail event logs, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

As per the documentation, VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from Amazon EC2 network interfaces. The SSH bruteforce attack
tries to guess the password pointing to port 22 on the instance. So when enabling the GuardDuty service, the VPC Flow logs are immediately analyzed
and unusual IP traffic activity can be detected.
